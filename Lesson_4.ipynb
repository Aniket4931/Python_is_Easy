    "## 27.**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is a programming paradigm that models the real world as a collection of objects that interact with each other. It emphasizes the concept of objects, which encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Objects:**\n",
    "   * Instances of classes that represent real-world entities or concepts.\n",
    "   * Each object has its own unique state (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Classes:**\n",
    "   * Blueprints or templates for creating objects.\n",
    "   * Define the attributes and methods that objects of that class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encapsulation:**\n",
    "   * Bundling data (attributes) and methods within an object to protect data integrity and control access.\n",
    "   * Achieved by making attributes private and providing public methods to interact with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Inheritance:**\n",
    "   * Creating new classes based on existing classes.\n",
    "   * Allows you to reuse code and create hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Polymorphism:**\n",
    "   * The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same message in different ways.\n",
    "   * Enables you to write more flexible and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.breed = breed\n",
    "\n",
    "  def bark(self):\n",
    "    print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "  def eat(self, food):\n",
    "    print(self.name + \" is eating \" + food)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create objects\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
    "dog2 = Dog(\"Max\", \"Labrador\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access attributes and call methods\n",
    "print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy\n",
    "dog1.bark()  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "dog2.eat(\"bone\")  # Output: Max is eating bone\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of OOP:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Modularity:** Breaks down complex problems into smaller, manageable objects.\n",
    "* **Reusability:** Encourages code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
    "* **Maintainability:** Makes code easier to understand, modify, and extend.\n",
    "* **Flexibility:** Provides flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements.\n",

    "\n",
    "A constructor is a special method in Python that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It's used to initialize the attributes of an object with initial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",

    "def __init__(self, args):\n",
    "  # Initialization code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__init__`: The name of the constructor method, which is a special method in Python.\n",
    "* `self`: A reference to the object being created.\n",
    "* `args`: The arguments passed to the constructor when creating the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `__init__` method is used to initialize the `name` and `age` attributes of the `Person` object. When the `Person` object is created, the `__init__` method is automatically called with the arguments `name` and `age`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Additional notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can define multiple constructors in a class using method overloading.\n",
    "* Constructors can be used to perform initialization tasks, such as connecting to databases or setting up default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Constructors in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports two types of constructors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Default Constructor:**\n",
    "   * A constructor that takes no arguments.\n",
    "   * It is automatically created by Python if you don't define one explicitly.\n",
    "   * It initializes the object's attributes with default values (usually `None`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Person:\n",
    "       pass  # Default constructor implicitly defined\n",
    "\n",
    "   person = Person()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parameterized Constructor:**\n",
    "   * A constructor that takes arguments and uses them to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
    "   * You can define multiple parameterized constructors in a class using method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Person:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, name, age):\n",

    "\n",
    "   person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Constructors are always named `__init__`.\n",
    "* The `self` parameter is automatically passed to the constructor and refers to the object being created.\n",
    "* You can define multiple constructors with different parameters.\n",
    "* The default constructor is implicitly defined if you don't define one explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing the right constructor:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a default constructor if you don't need to provide initial values for attributes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows you to create new classes based on existing classes. This promotes code reusability and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Base Class (Parent Class):** The original class from which other classes are derived.\n",
    "* **Derived Class (Child Class):** A new class that inherits attributes and methods from a base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class DerivedClass(BaseClass):\n",
    "    # Derived class code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A derived class automatically inherits all the attributes and methods of its base class.\n",
    "2. You can override inherited methods in the derived class to provide different implementations.\n",
    "3. Derived classes can have their own unique attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",

    "dog.speak()  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "cat.speak()  # Output: Meow!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Inheritance:**\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance:**\n",
    "   * A derived class inherits from a single base class.\n",
    "   * This is the most common type of inheritance.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",

    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. **Multiple Inheritance:**\n",
    "   * A derived class inherits from multiple base classes.\n",
    "   * This can be useful for combining features from different classes.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color):\n",

    "    def ride(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Bike riding\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. **Multilevel Inheritance:**\n",
    "   * A derived class inherits from another derived class, creating a chain of inheritance.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",

    "        print(\"Boost activated\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance:**\n",
    "   * Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",

    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Meow!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. **Hybrid Inheritance:**\n",
    "   * A combination of multiple and multilevel inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color):\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Method Overriding:**\n",
    "   * When a derived class defines a method with the same name as a method in its base class, this method overrides the base class method.\n",
